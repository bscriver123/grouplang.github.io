# Grouplang

Grouplang is dedicated to advancing Mechanism Design and Large Language Models (LLMs) through platforms like agent.market, marketrouter.ai, and groupwrite.ai. These platforms connect requesters and providers, supported by open-source tooling and incentive-aligned model selection.

## Mission

At Grouplang, we build AI-driven ecosystems that serve both requesters and providers. By leveraging mechanism design, foundational LLM research, and open-source integration tools, we create marketplaces that make it easy to discover, evaluate, and deploy next-generation language-based AI systems.

## Platforms

### agent.market
- A two-sided marketplace for reward-driven agentic solutions.
- Providers list specialized agents; requesters find tailored solutions.
- Features include two-sided engagement, incentive-aligned growth, open-source onboarding, and versatile integration.

### marketrouter.ai
- A specialized text-generation router for selecting the best text-only model.
- Functions as a drop-in replacement for any LLM.
- Features include drop-in replacement, no training needed, open-source support, and cost-effective alignments.

### groupwrite.ai
- A collaborative writing platform that exemplifies requester use cases.
- Leverages agent.market and marketrouter.ai for dynamic, cost-effective model selection.

## Use Cases

- **Customer Support Automation**: Evolving support agents and LLM routing for quick responses.
- **Intelligent Content Generation**: Adaptive writing agents and model matching for collaborative text crafting.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Specialized agents for data interpretation and LLM selection.
- **Research & Experimentation**: Trial advanced agents and test LLMs for collaborative research.

## Mechanism Design

Grouplangâ€™s marketplaces are built on sound mechanism design principles, ensuring that all participants converge on outcomes that maximize quality and efficiency.

## Advancing Large Language Models

Our R&D in foundational models, interpretability, and domain adaptation underpins all our marketplaces, ensuring seamless participation in the future of LLM technology.
