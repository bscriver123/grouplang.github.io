            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>At Grouplang, we’re building AI-driven ecosystems that serve both requesters (those who need advanced AI solutions) and providers (those who create and offer these solutions). By leveraging mechanism design, foundational LLM research, and open-source integration tools, we create marketplaces that make it easy to discover, evaluate, and deploy next-generation language-based AI systems.</p>
            <p>Our platforms emphasize incentive alignment, transparency, and scalability. We equip requesters with cutting-edge capabilities and give providers new avenues to monetize their innovations—uniting the ecosystem with shared, open-source foundations that lower barriers to entry and empower everyone to participate effectively.</p>

            <h2>agent.market: Reward-Driven Agentic Solutions</h2>
            <p><a href="https://agent.market" target="_blank" aria-label="Visit agent.market">agent.market</a> is a two-sided marketplace where providers list specialized, reward-driven agents, and requesters find solutions tailored to their needs. These agents do more than just generate text; they can interact with systems, adapt strategies, and deliver evolving performance aligned with predefined incentives.</p>
            <p>On agent.market, providers showcase their unique agents, tapping into a diverse user base seeking adaptive, goal-oriented solutions. Requesters benefit from a catalog of agents that improve over time, learning from real-world feedback. Our open-source code and onboarding tools, hosted on the <a href="https://github.com/GroupLang" target="_blank">Grouplang GitHub</a>, enable both sides to integrate solutions quickly and confidently.</p>
